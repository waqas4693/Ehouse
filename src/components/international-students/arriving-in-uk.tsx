          The immigration officer will interview you in English, and you are expected to answer in English. Usually, there are two main queues: One is meant for European Economic Area and Swiss nationals, while the other is for everyone else. Kindly ensure you join the correct queue. Make sure the immigration Officer has put a date stamp on your passport before leaving Immigration Control.

          At most international airports, baggage is usually dropped off at one of the carousels in the baggage collection area.Find your flight number and the name of your flightâ€™s departure location on the screens or above the carousels and wait for each item of your baggage to emerge.

          It is also essential for you to know about eGates when you arrive in the United Kingdom. eGates are an alternative to seeing an immigration officer/border force officer. They are automated self-service barriers located at immigration checkpoints at UK airports. The eGates are for people who hold a current passport (with a biometric chip) from Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and the United States of America. As a non-visa national seeking entry to the UK on a Short-Term Student Visa, you must MAKE sure you see a Border Force officer instead of using the eGates

          Once you have found all the items of your baggage, you must go through customs control. There are 3 channels at customs control. The green channel is for people who have nothing to declare, the red channel is for people who have goods to declare and the blue channel is for those who arrive from an airport of the European Union (EU). Those who can go through the blue channel have already cleared all of their baggage through customs control. Please note that even if you pass through the green channel, you may be asked to open up your luggage for inspection.
