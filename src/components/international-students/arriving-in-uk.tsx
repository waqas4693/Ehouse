              The immigration officer will interview you in English, and you are expected to answer in English. Usually, there are two main queues: One is meant for European
              Economic Area and Swiss nationals, while the other is for everyone else. Kindly ensure you join the correct queue. Make sure the immigration Officer has put a date
              stamp on your passport before leaving Immigration Control.

              At most international airports, baggage is usually dropped off at one of the carousels in the baggage collection area.Find your flight number and the name of your
              flightâ€™s departure location on the screens or above the carousels and wait for each item of your baggage to emerge. If something goes wrong, find a representative
              from the airline you have travelled with and complete a lost baggage form.

              It is also essential for you to know about eGates when you arrive in the United Kingdom. eGates are an alternative to seeing an immigration officer/border force officer.
              They are automated self-service barriers located at immigration checkpoints at UK airports. The eGates are for people who hold a current passport (with a biometric
              chip) from Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and the United States of America. As a non-visa national seeking entry to the UK on a
              Short-Term Student Visa, you must MAKE sure you see a Border Force officer instead of using the eGates

              Once you have found all the items of your baggage, you must go through customs control. There are 3 channels at customs control. The green channel is for people
              who have nothing to declare, the red channel is for people who have goods to declare and the blue channel is for those who arrive from an airport of the European
              Union (EU). Those who can go through the blue channel have already cleared all of their baggage through customs control. Please note that even if you pass
              through the green channel, you may be asked to open up your luggage for inspection.
